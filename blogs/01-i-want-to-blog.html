    <p class="subheader">But Why?</p>
    <p>
      I'm only starting out as a cs student. Why would I want to write a blog?, what can I add to the world with my words?
      These are questions rising in my head whenever I think about starting a blog. They feel like valid questions, and I don't expect anyone get something usefull
      from my corner of the internet. But when I think about my day, I have to admit it is always partially filled with reading blogs that I find through HN. And
      these blogs are well structured pieces of text. And this is something I struggle with at the moment. And it is a skill I hope to advance in.
    </p>
    <p class="subheader">That's why</p>
    <p>
      I want to get better at writing. And I hope to arrive at a point in my life where people can get something from reading my blog. What will I writ about? I don't quite know yet. things that live in my head now are:

    <p>
      I want to contribute to OSS in a way or another, but I have no experience with that at the moment<br>
      I am a cs student doing an internship at the moment (september 2021) Maybe I can share some insights I have about doing cs and how I do it<br>
    </p>

      Who knows what will happen. But I have pushed writing this first post ahead of me for a few years now. It is too short now, but it will hopefully be extended. Having a first part of me on the internet hopefully helped me overcome this hurdle, but who knows.
